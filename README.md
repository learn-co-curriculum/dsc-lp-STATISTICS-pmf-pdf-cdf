#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson starts by asking students to explain the difference between permutations and combinations. From there, it dives into two applied examples of permutations and combinations. If time is permitted explaining the intuition behind these concepts is recommended. From there, the lesson continues onto conditional probability and partitioning complex scenarios into simple examples.

#### Lesson Outline:

* Problem Posed: Combinations vs Permutations (5+min)
	* padlock anecdote (a nice example)
* Applied Practice (10min-15minutes)
	* Padlocks + Pizza
	Start with concrete solutions to problems and move towards deeper understanding with conceptual intuitions behind permutations and combinations.
    
* Conditional Probability Example (10 minutes)
    * When do we compute conditional probabilities? (2 minutes)
        * Motivate the discussion of conditional probability by talking about dependent events. 
    * Applied practice (8 minutes)
        * Bruised and edible mushrooms.
            * Level up: Repeat the exercise with other features in the mushroom dataset. 
        * Intuition
            * Different sample spaces 
            
* Partitioning (10)
* Summary (10 min)
