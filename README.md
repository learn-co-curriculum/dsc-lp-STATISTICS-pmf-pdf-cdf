#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson covers PMFs, PDFs and CDFs. The lesson alternates between reviewing key concepts and asking students conceptual and applied practice problems to gauge and deepen their understanding. The section on CDFs makes connections to percentiles. The section of PMFs reviews the Poisson distribution. There is currently also an addendum on z-tests to deepen students understanding of PDFs.

#### Topic:

Statistics 

#### Learn.co material:

#### Prerequisite knowledge:

Basic python, matplotlib and importing packages. Ideally, students should have previewed the Learn material on PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs.
